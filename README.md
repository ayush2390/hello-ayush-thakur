# Creating Your Own NPX Introduction Package

Creating your own `npx` introduction package is a interesting and unique way. The `npx` command allows you to run Node.js-based packages without having to globally install them. Here's how you can do it. A step-by-step guide

## Step 1: Choose a Package Name

Think of a unique name for your introduction package. This name will be used to execute your introduction command using `npx`.

## Step 2: Create a New Directory

Create a new directory for your package. If you want, you can give it the same name that you have given to your package.

```bash
mkdir intro-package-name
cd intro-package-name
```

## Step 3: Initialize Your Package

Initialize your project as a Node.js package by running the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

## Create an Executable Script

Inside your project directory, create a JavaScript file that will work as the executable script for your npx command. Name this file as index.js. You can use the index.js file of my repository or edit it accordingly.

### Make sure to define bin in 'package.json'

```json
"bin": {
  "my-npx-command": "./index.js"
},
```

## Make the Script Executable

In your terminal, make your script file executable by running:

### For Linux

```
chmod +x index.js
```

### For Windows

**Note:** git should be installed.

```powershell
git update-index --chmod=+x index.js
```

## Test your command

- Link the package using `npm link`
- Test by running the command `npx package-name`
- If it works as expected, make sure to unlink it using `npm unlink -g directory-name`

## Publish your package

- Make an [npm account](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Login to your account using the command `npm login`
- Publish the package using the command `npm publish`

Share it with your friends and amaze them!
